# Profile Page

## Use the HTML and CSS provided

* On submit, get the values of the form fields and create a profile card. You can create the card in HTML, leave it hidden with CSS by default and populate it with data via JS.

* On reset, clear the form and remove the generated card

* Display errors if a field is missing: use custom errors rather than built in HTML5 error handling

> Note: You will need to adjust the path for the image to work

* Add a reset button for the card: clear the form and remove the generated card

Extra: add age
